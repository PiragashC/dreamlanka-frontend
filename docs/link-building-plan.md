# Buildora Engineers Link Building Strategy

## Objectives
- Grow referring domains in Sri Lanka and regional construction niches.
- Secure high-authority dofollow links to improve domain rating.
- Earn local citations that reinforce NAP (name, address, phone) consistency.

## Priority Tactics
1. **Project Showcase Outreach**
   - Publish 2–3 in-depth case studies per quarter.
   - Pitch stories to Sri Lankan architecture blogs and regional business journals.
   - Offer royalty-free imagery for inclusion with backlinks to `/projects`.

2. **Partnership & Supplier Mentions**
   - Coordinate mutual backlinks with engineering partners, material suppliers, and subcontractors.
   - Provide pre-written blurbs + logos to simplify their publishing process.

3. **Local Citations & Directories**
   - Submit consistent NAP data to Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Yelp LK, and construction directories.
   - Target at least 15 citation sites; track submissions in a shared spreadsheet.

4. **Thought Leadership & Webinars**
   - Host quarterly webinars on compliance, green building, or BIM workflows.
   - Share recordings on YouTube and embed on `/resources` with slides available for media pickup.
   - Syndicate articles to LinkedIn Pulse and Medium, linking back to relevant resource pages.

5. **Community & CSR Coverage**
   - Sponsor local events or apprenticeships; provide media kits to local newsrooms.
   - Encourage NGOs and chambers of commerce to mention Buildora’s involvement with backlinks.

## Measurement
- Track referring domains, DR/DA, and traffic to `/contact` via analytics dashboards.
- Review backlink profile monthly for toxic links and disavow when necessary.
- Iterate messaging every quarter based on response rates and coverage wins.
